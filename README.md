# windows-license-extractor
Script to display your local machine's Windows 10 license key.

# How it works?
Simply run the script as administrator on your Windows 10 computer. A small window will popup with your exposed Windows 10 license key.

# Why?
This is especially a concern when buying a prebuilt computer. In the event that Windows 10 is already installed, you do not have access to that license key (license key that you've technically bought). If you use my windows 10 license extractor, you will be able to see that license key, and write the result on a piece of paper. So if something happens to your computer, you still have the license key writen down somewhere. You can use your key again to a newer computer. - This will deactivate your current computer's license (1 license key, 1 computer at a time).
